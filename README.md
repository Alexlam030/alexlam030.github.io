**Conclusions:** GameCo should focus region specific needs. The shooter, sports, and role-playing genres are the most popular in various regions. Other genres are shown to have high sales, but this is a result of outliers. The outliers have not been historically consistent. Further data should be gather afterwards to check on performance.

## Creating A Marketing Strategy Based On Customer Profiles

**Objective:** Instacart is an app based online grocery store. They want to analyze their sales in order to develop a targeted marketing strategy.

**Tools used:** Python, Powerpoint, Excel

The highest selling departments through out all regions include: produce, dairy eggs, and snacks. (Department ID labels are included in the data.) The lowest selling departments are bulk, other, and deli.

Customers are divided by customer profiles. There are several variables that define a customer: marriage status, parenthood, and age. The customer profiles help the marketing team target each person with a relevant ad. The highest population for customer profile is married parent adults.

Instacart should have marketing based on customer profiles. Customer profiles allow for specific marketing to each user. Ads should be for both the highest selling items and lowest selling items. This item selection will both help Instacart be competitive and increase sales of its least popular items. The most important customer profiles to focus on are married parent adults, since they are the largest population, but others should be considered as well.

## Analyzing Trends From A Variety of Consumers

**Objective:** CitiBike wishes to both expand its client base and keep its current clients happy.

**Tools used:** Python, Tableau

**Explaining The Clients:** CitiBike has two groups of customers: subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers are people who signed up for the CitiBike service who can use a bike located at a CitiBike station located in New York for either a monthly or yearly fee. Non-subscribers are users who do not have a subscription who pay per ride.

Subscribers and non-subscribers share some similarities such as their ride schedules, but differ in many things such as ride times and ride days. Even within the subscriber group, there are many different groups separated by things such as age or gender.

**Exploring And Changing The Variables:** Python was used to check for null values. All variables except for birth_year did not have null values. Birth_year’s null values can be explained, because non-subscribers do not have to input their birth year. As seen with the previous slide, there are 6979 non-subscribers which making the null values acceptable.

**Subscribers Vs Non-Subscribers:** Subscribers and non-subscribers have similar attributes. An example would be how both user types start using the service around 8:00 am, but stop using the service as much around 6:00 pm. The key in figuring out how to please each group is to learn their differences as well. For example, Non-subscribers mostly use Citibike during the weekend, but subscribers are the opposite using the service during the weekdays.

**Subscriber Subgroups:** Subscribers are very diverse with many different ways to categorize them. For example, there are differences between both male and female users. There is a higher pecertage of male users, but on average female riders are shown to have longer trips. Another variable to categorize subscribers is age as well.

**Conclusions:** CitiBike must attract non-subscribers by either changing the service to accommodate for their uses or encourage them to go on longer rides.
Current subscribers can be appealed to by looking into the subscriber minorities: women, college students, etc. A survey would benefit CitiBike by figuring out what these minority groups need.
