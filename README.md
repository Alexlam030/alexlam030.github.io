# About Me
Hello, my name is Alex. I’m a data analyst who is an eager story teller. I have the ability to
identify connections between data sets and visualize the connections afterwards. My experience
in multiple financial institutions gives me the insight on the need for a timely yet accurate view
on money, but my skills can apply to a myriad of industries. My experience with my certificates has given me further experience in looking at trends. I’m excited to use my insights and experience to analyze large data sets and give
insights on personnel trends that can guide business decisions and lead to success.
